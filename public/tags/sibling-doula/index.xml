      <description>Emilie was referred to us for her sibling doula services from a local midwife and I couldn&amp;rsquo;t have been happier with her support! I didn&amp;rsquo;t even know sibling doulas were a thing! We had a 19 month old at the time of our homebirth and with no family support in the area we needed someone to take care of our toddler during the labor and delivery. Emilie came over a few weeks before the birth to meet our toddler and us, and learn about her routine, the house layout, etc.</description>
