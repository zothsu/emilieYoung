      <description>I had the pleasure of working as co-doula with Emilie. I highly recommend her as either a birth or postpartum doula. She is both light-hearted and wise. She brings such a warmth to her work! Emilie shared excellent resources in the prenatal appointments and helped the client make an easy-to-read birth plan, which all the nurses loved!
During the birth, Emilie provided continuous encouragement. She suggested different positions and provided gentle comfort measures.</description>
