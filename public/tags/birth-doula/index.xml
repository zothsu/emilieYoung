      <description>Emilie was essential to my birth.&#xA;Labor is hard and It was one of the biggest workouts of my life. My husband was my mental support and Emilie was my labor foundation. She kept me hydrated, not waiting for me to ask for water but offering me water with a straw every so often. She tracked down my protein shake and even managed to find me some fruit to snack on when we had forgotten our own snacks.</description>

      <description>Emilie came into my life when I was very depressed and in need of any kind of support.&#xA;Having had to deliver my first baby alone in the US, and away from my husband and family, through a c-section too, I had to go through a lot on my own which drained me physically and emotionally. I was in pain and depressed the whole time, and cried everyday.&#xA;Emilie&amp;rsquo;s presence in my life changed everything.</description>
