      Hi there! I'm Emilie, a doula based in the beautiful city of Portland, Oregon. Ever since I attended my first birth, I knew this was my calling. I believe every birthing person deserves to feel empowered, respected, and deeply supported throughout their journey.
      
      As your doula, I bring my whole heart to the birthing room. I'm here to advocate fiercely for your needs and wishes, ensuring that you have a voice in every decision. My compassionate approach means I'll be by your side, offering comfort, encouragement, and hands-on support when you need it most.

      Birth is a profound and unique experience, and my goal is to help make it as positive and empowering as possible for you and your family. I can't wait to walk this incredible path with you, bringing calm, confidence, and unwavering support to your birth experience.
