Emilie was with us a few nights a week for 3 months after my second son was born. While hiring a night doula was an investment, it was the best decision our family made for the postpartum period. I had been dreading the fourth trimester after a difficult time with my first baby. Emilie made the experience completely different and way better. Having sleep throughout the week allowed me to really enjoy my time with my new baby (and also with my toddler!). My husband and I were able to relax knowing our baby was well cared for. In the morning we were rested, our baby was fed and happy and our house was tidy! It was such a gift and I would do it again in a heartbeat.
