I had the pleasure of working as co-doula with Emilie. I highly recommend her as either a birth or postpartum doula. She is both light-hearted and wise. She brings such a warmth to her work! Emilie shared excellent resources in the prenatal appointments and helped the client make an easy-to-read birth plan, which all the nurses loved!

During the birth, Emilie provided continuous encouragement. She suggested different positions and provided gentle comfort measures. She is very knowledgeable and explained the hospital processes in a clear way. She did a wonderful job validating the client's emotions at all times. I am so glad I had the opportunity to work with her! Any family who gets to work with her is a lucky family!
